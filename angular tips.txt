ngModal = implementing two way binding 
 
(email is a componenet property)


<input [value] = "email" .... ==> One way Binding Comp --> View

<input [(ngModal)] = "email" ==> two way binding

** to use two way binding we should import : Forms Module from '@angular/forms'
and add it to imports in app.module.ts
